# Automated video editing script using Python and MoviePy

Sometimes, the task of editing numerous videos in a similar and straightforward manner arises. For instance, assembling numerous clips from a football game.

This script can divide a full game (hours of video) into several clips. Although the task is simple, it can be tedious and time-consuming for a human editor. Utilizing Python & MoviePy liberates a video editor to focus on more creative aspects of the job.

This script is suitable for any editing task where the required actions are well-defined and manual execution would be excessively time-consuming. Examples include TV programs, data visualizations, visual effects footage, and more. There's no need to rely on video editing software (such as Adobe Premiere) to accomplish the task.

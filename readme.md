# Automated video editing script using Python and MoviePy

In my work, sometimes I have to edit many videos in a very similar and simple way. For example, put together lots of clips from a football game.

This script could split a full game (hours of video) into a few clips: The task is simple, but a human would find it boring and time-wasting. Using Python & MoviePy frees a video editor for more creative parts of the job.

This script is good for any editing job where you know exactly what to do and doing it by hand would take too long, for example: TV programs, data visualizations, visual effects footage and more. It's not necessary to run a video editing software (in my case, Adobe Premiere) to do the work.
